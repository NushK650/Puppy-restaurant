Peer Review: I'd almost call it a perfect website. Responsiveness was impressive. The code is nicely organized. The format on laptop seems like a perfect 1:1 recreation. The tablet view is great. The mobile screen's navbar could be centered so that the options are listed vertically. That's the only note I have on this. Well done!
